# "HashMap Project" for The Odin Project 

Made by **roznerx** (ignaciorosner@gmail.com)

## Notes [01/22/2024]:

- Not really a project but more of a practice for *Linked Lists*, which is part of the new "A Bit of Computer Science" section.
- Still on my mission to complete The Odin Project, albeit already working in the industry. This "A Bit of Computer Science" section quite difficult for me, yet it triggers my curiosity about CS!
